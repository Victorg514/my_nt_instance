# Personalized Mental Health Detection from Social Media Behavior

This project explores the efficacy of personalized, behavior-based machine learning models for detecting mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder) from Twitter/X user data. The core hypothesis is that a user's deviation from their unique behavioral baseline is a more robust signal than post content alone.

The repository contains a full end-to-end pipeline for data processing, model training, evaluation, and explainability. It includes both a 4-class multiclass model and a more advanced One-vs-Rest (OvR) ensemble of specialized binary classifiers.
